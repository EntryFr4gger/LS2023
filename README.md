# Tasks API

## Introduction

The Tasks API project has the goal if both implementing an API and a SPA for a project that works somewhat like the
[Trello](https://trello.com/) application.

Its goals are to provide task organization and syncronization between several people, by providing
a way for you to manage your projects with a user-friendly interface, 
empowering you to organize and collaborate seamlessly. 
Create boards to represent different projects and divide them into goals using lists. 
Each task in a goal is a card that you can customize content. 
The application provides a centralized space for project syncronizing. 
By simplifying the workflow and promoting efficient collaboration, 
our application takes your projects to the next level.

## Critical Evaluation

There here are some functionalities that didn't make it due to time constraints:

* Cannot unarchive a card via the SPA
* Drag and drop of the cards
* Further testing on all API routes

We also hope to improve:

* General beauty of the website
* Clean up the API calls, and their inner workings
